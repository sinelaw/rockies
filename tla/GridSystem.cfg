CONSTANTS
    GridPos = {g1, g2}
    PlayerId = {p1}

(* Initial state and next-state relation *)
INIT Init
NEXT Next

(* Invariants to check *)
INVARIANT 
    TypeOK
    KnownDirtyStatus

(*
  Optional:
  You can add additional invariants here to check properties you expect to hold.
  For example:
  INVARIANT (FORALL g IN GridPos : (grid_load_status[g] = "loaded") => (grid_state[g] \in {"missing", "stored"}))
  This invariant would check that a loaded grid is always either missing or stored persistently.

  You can also specify properties for liveness checking, e.g.:
  PROPERTIES
    WF_vars(Next) (* Weak fairness on all variables changing in Next *)
*)

(*
  Optional:
  To reduce the state space for initial exploration, you can use:
  VIEW
    <<grid_state, grid_load_status, grid_dirty_status, player_positions>>
  This tells TLC to only display these variables in the state graph.
